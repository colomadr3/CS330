Comp Graphic and Visualization

    How do I approach designing software?
    I am trying to plan thing out before jumping into code. I determine the requirements, the inputs, how it processes those inputs, and the expected outputs.
    
        What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
        Visualizing how the graphics were going to be created and understanding the flow of execution between class calls.
        
        What design process did you follow for your project work?
        It was an iterative design process. I coded and compiled in small chunks to assess progress and adjust on the fly.
        
        How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
        Coding in chunks and making my code more modular allows me to catch issues early and isolate problem potions.
        
    How do I approach developing programs?
    I gather all the information gained during the design process and start coding with a goal in mind. I focus on specific functions and implement them piece by piece.
    
        What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
        OpenGL is new to me, so I needed to gain familiarity with the syntax, structure, and flow before diving in. I jumped in head first at the start of the class and got overwhelmed pretty
        quickly. I had to start from scratch and slowly I developed the thought process needed to get through the class.
        
        How did iteration factor into your development?
        Immensely! It was trial and error for me. I would research, try some code, test it, and research again. I made small progresses and built on that to complete the project.
        
        How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
        I have learned not to overestimate myself and my abilities. I need to take things slow and do everything I can to gain as much understanding as possible before tackling obstacles.
        
    How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
    Brother, computer science is my goal. I want to get my degree, so I can get a better and more fulfilling job.
    
        How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
        It is a new skill that encompasses many of the throught processes behind programing. It is nice to see how matrix math plays a part in code and how the computer translate code into shapes.
        Computational graphics and visualization helped me to practically apply knowledge I have been gaining in my school career.
        
        How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
        It would be cool to get a job that utilizes Computational graphics and visualization. I do not think I am at that level yet, but I hope it will help me build a strong portfolio to impress 
        potential employers.
